# CodingWeek 2017 - Sample project

This project provides a sample application that demonstrates the use of [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for building a JavaFX application.

It provides basic dependencies such as [Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) for logging messages, [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) for unit testing and [GitLab API for Java](https://github.com/gmessner/gitlab4j-api) for conversing with a GitLab server.

All these dependencies are defined in the `build.gradle` file. You can freely edit this file in order to add your own dependencies or replace GitLab API for Java library with [Java GitLab API](https://github.com/timols/java-gitlab-api) (by uncommenting `org.gitlab:java-gitlab-api:1.2.8`)

## Basic Gradle commands

Gradle will help you to build and distribute your project. It will allow you to easily manage your dependencies.

Gradle supports the following commands on this project:
- `gradle test` to run the unit tests
- `gradle run` to run the project as a Java application
- `gradle assembleDist` to bundle the project as distribution in a `.zip` and a `.tar` files.
- `gradle clean` to clean up the project (deletes the `build` and `dist` directories)
- `gradle tasks` to list all the available tasks
